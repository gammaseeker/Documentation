# Data Structures
These Jupyter Notebooks are designed to teach the intermediate level computer science student about various data structures.<br>
These notebooks assume that you know how to code, have passed your introduction to computer science course and have already learned about arrays and lists.<br>
All implementations shown are in Java.
The recommended sequence of topics are: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Big O Notation </li>
  <li>Introduction to Data Structures</li>
  <li>Arrays</li>
